- After installation, run Windows Update until fully updated.  
- (Optional) Install **VirtualBox Guest Additions** for better display/input.  
- (Optional) Prepare for SOC tooling (you can add your exact steps later).

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell (as Administrator) as needed later in your lab
# Placeholder for tools you plan to use:
# e.g., Enable script execution temporarily (if required by your tools)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```
